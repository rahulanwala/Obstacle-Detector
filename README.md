# Obstacle-Detector
I collaborated with four friends on a project aimed at developing an obstacle detector for blind individuals. Our goal was to create a device that would help them navigate their surroundings more effectively. To bring our concept to life, we utilized Tinkercad, an online platform for circuit design and simulation.

Using Tinkercad, we designed and simulated our obstacle detection model, incorporating a distance sensor as a key component. This sensor enabled us to accurately measure the proximity of obstacles in real time. Based on the distance measured, we programmed the system to emit different tones through a buzzer. This audio feedback provided the blind person with valuable information about the distance between themselves and the obstacle.

In addition to the obstacle detection functionality, we wanted to make our device more inclusive. To achieve this, we added a switch and light feature to assist individuals who are visually impaired. The switch allowed users to activate or deactivate the device as needed, while the light provided visual cues or indications. By considering the needs of a wider range of users, we aimed to enhance the overall usability and accessibility of our obstacle detector.

As part of my specific contribution, I focused on debugging the code and optimizing the circuit's productivity. I meticulously analyzed and identified any issues or errors in the code, ensuring that the system operated flawlessly. Additionally, I worked on increasing the circuit's productivity by implementing improvements such as adding a switch and light. These enhancements aimed to streamline the device's functionality and enhance the user experience.

To complement our project, my teammate created a 3D model of the device housing using Solidworks, a popular CAD software. This allowed us to visualize and design a user-friendly enclosure for our obstacle detector. The 3D model helped us ensure that the components fit properly and that the device was ergonomically designed, further enhancing its practicality and usability.

Overall, our project demonstrated the successful integration of hardware and software skills. By leveraging Tinkercad, Solidworks, and our collective expertise, we developed an obstacle detection system with audio feedback, inclusive features, and a visually appealing 3D model.
